		The talent show is an event to celebrate the multifaceted personality of UCLA engineers. We arenâ€™t just limited to our Boelter navigational skills or our all-nighters. Have a talent you think is worth showing off? Have a skill that makes the crowd go manic? Then showcase it at the talent show by submitting a pre-recorded video and competing for exciting prizes (1st, 2nd and 3rd). Videos will be shown over Zoom.
