		While we’re online, who says networking can’t happen? The Online Networking Night is hosted in a casual, conversational format for engineering students to be able to connect with alumni and ESUC’s corporate sponsors, in small groups. Whether you’re new to UCLA or going to graduate soon, this is a great way to start (or continue) building valuable professional relationships!
