		IN COLLABORATION WITH SMASH @ UCLA, ESUC will be hosting a Smash Ultimate tournament composed of both singles and double events. This will be on the same day so please keep that in mind when signing up. Prizes will be available for first place singles and first place team doubles only. Anybody can join the tournament, but only UCLA students will be eligible for the prize. If a situation occurs when a non-UCLA student wins, the prize will be passed down to the next-standing team/individual.
